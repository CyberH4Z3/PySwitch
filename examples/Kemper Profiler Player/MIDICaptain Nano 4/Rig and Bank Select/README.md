## Exampe Description

This selects rigs 1 to 4 with all four switches of the Nano. Holding A or B changes the bank (up or down)

The next bank selected on long press of A and B is also displayed using one LED on each switch. 

**Note that the controller does not know (yet) about an eventual restriction of max. bank (Kemper setting "Max. Banks"), so the shown color does not regard that setting!**
