    <h2>About PySwitch Emulator</h2>
    <br>    
    This emulates the <a href="https://github.com/Tunetown/PySwitch" target="_blank">PySwitch</a> open source MIDI controller firmware in your browser. You can:
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Load configuration files from any connected controller</b> running PySwitch (like a MIDI Captain) via MIDI into the emulator
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Edit the configuration</b> in a user friendly way with a <b>Graphical User Interface</b>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Save updated configuration files</b> directly to the connected controller via MIDI
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    It would be just another config tool if you could not do this, too:
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Control any connected client device (like Kemper Profiler Player) in realtime</b> from your browser while editing the patches. The emulated device will control your Kemper just like the real one, even without any controller connected!
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Quickly open and test all examples</b> delivered with PySwitch, connected to your <b>real Kemper device, all within the browser</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Scan for connected controllers and clients automatically
        </li>
        <li>
            Edit the code in sync with the graphical editor: You can use your own implementations, they will not be destroyed by the code generator.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    When you start up the application the first time, it will automatically scan all available MIDI ports for connected controllers. If one is found, it will automatically load its configuration.
    <br>
    <br>
    After a connection has been loaded, the application scans for available clients to control. The first one found (for example a Kemper Profiler Player) will be connected, or, if none has been found, a virtual Kemper Player is used. You can override this by clicking on the button at the bottom right and selecting a device manually.
