# Definitions for PySwitch Emulator

This defines the available actions and their parameters:

- **actions.json**: This describes the available actions. The file is generated by the Jasmine unit tests. Just run the tests, if the definitions are out of date, a new version will be downloaded which should replace the old one.

- **mappings.json**: This describes the available mappings. The file is generated by the Jasmine unit tests. Just run the tests, if the definitions are out of date, a new version will be downloaded which should replace the old one.

- **meta.json**: This defines metadata, for example for the parameters of the other definitions. You have to define this manually, providing types, ranges, defaults etc. which enhance and override the defaults defined in actions.json and mappings.json. Jasmine unit tests will fail if any parameter is not described here (defaults are possible).
