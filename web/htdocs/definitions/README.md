# Definitions for PySwitch Emaulator

This defines the available actions and their parameters:

- **actions.json**: This describes the actions themselves. The file is generated by the Jasmine unit tests. Just run the tests, if the definitions are out of date, a new version will be downloaded which should replace the old one.
- **action-parameters.json**: This defines metadata for the action parameters. You have to define this manually, providing types, ranges, defaults etc. which enhance and override the defaults defined in actions.json. Jasmine unit tests will fail if any action's parameter is not described here.
